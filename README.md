# assignment

A graph traversal program as part of a programming test.

All relevant code is contained within assignment_redo.cpp

I was only able to complete 2 out of the 5 questions, as I wasted a lot of time at the start stressing over what type of data structure to use and how to make it efficient. I ended up just hardcoding the graph values as it simplified the actual solution without having to worry about the data structure.

I also took the liberty of changing the representation of the nodes from a,b,c,d,e to 0,1,2,3,4.
